# Track hub for C2C12 LR-Split-seq paper

This UCSC Genome Browser track hub link is used in our publication (in particular, Fig. 4C).

It will display the following:

1. snATAC-seq pseudobulk peaks across 18 clusters (bigwigs)
2. Merged psuedobulk snATAC-seq peaks across all clusters (bigBeg)
3. TSS regions called from LR-Split-seq (bigBed)
4. ENCODE cCREs (bigBed)
5. LR-Split-seq reads across 7 clusters, used to call TSSs (bams and bam indices)
6. Comprehensive set of GENCODE vM21 (bigBed)
